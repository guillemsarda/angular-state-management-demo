# angular-state-management-demo

This is an app that contains two counters in different components to prove that you can centralize the states of an Angular app using `BehaviorSubject` from `rxjs`.

In order to run the app you only have to access the `client` directory and run:
- `npm i` to install al the dependencies.
- `npm start` to run the app in the browser.

Cheers! ✌🏼

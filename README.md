# angular-state-management-demo

This app contains two counters in different components to prove that you can centralize the states of an Angular app using `BehaviorSubject` from `rxjs`.

To run it you only have to access the `client` directory and run:
- `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
- `npm start` to run the app in the browser.

Cheers! ✌🏼
